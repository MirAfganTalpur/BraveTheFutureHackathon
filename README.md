# BraveTheFutureHackathon
Our submission for the 2019 Brave the Future Hackathon.

We placed third in a 48-hour hackathon for the Brave the Future campaign at UOIT (Ontario Tech). The goal was to develop a mobile app prototype that will engage users to explore Brave The Future. Final apps were presented in a live five-minute pitch to a panel of judges.

Our app showcased the Brave the Future campaign, with a heavy focus on Brave the Future branding and a fun, intuitive UI and UX.

# How to Install/Run
